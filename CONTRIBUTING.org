* Style guide
** Use brittany
Use [[https://github.com/lspitzner/brittany][Brittany]] to format code.

** Use complete sentences
Wherever possible, use complete sentences ended by full stops. This includes
error messages, warnings, and comments. Headline, list items or mathematical
objects may be excluded. For example,
#+begin_example
- A
- B
- C
#+end_example
or,
#+begin_example
Length: 10.13
#+end_example

* Design principles
** Files and standard input
Binaries should accept input files, and not the standard input, because ELynx is
designed for reproducible runs.
