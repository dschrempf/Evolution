* Style guide
** Use complete sentences
Wherever possible, use complete sentences ended by full stops. This includes
error messages and warnings. Headline, list items or mathematical objects may be
excluded. For example,
#+begin_example
- A
- B
- C
#+end_example
or,
#+begin_example
Length: 10.13
#+end_example

** Positions of operators
Put operators at the end of lines. For example,
#+begin_src haskell
args = Args <$>
       alphabetOpt <*>
       optional outFileBaseNameOpt <*>
       verbosityOpt <*>
       commandArg
#+end_src
This does not involve type declarations, because of documentation. For example,
#+begin_src haskell
subsample :: (PrimMonad m)
          => Int                    -- ^ How many samples?
          -> MultiSequenceAlignment -- ^ The alignment to sample from.
          -> m MultiSequenceAlignment
#+end_src

* Design principles
** Files and standard input
Binaries should accept both, a file and standard input. If a binary works on
multiple files, the files must be delimited by a specific delimiter when given
through standard input.
