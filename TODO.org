* Notes
** Read from standard input
I decided to not provide an option for reading from STDIN, since this is a
corner case and additionally because behavior might be undefined when more than
one input file is given. When does one file end and the next one begin?

** Automatic code detection
I decided that there should not be any automatic code detection. Reaons:
1. Reproducible runs.
2. Separation between extended and IUPAC codes.

* Easy

* Medium
** TODO Improve output of (mixture, gamma) model

** TODO Enable description in FASTA files sequence headers

** TODO Investigate the Haddock warning because of deriveUnboxed

* Hard

* Requires further tought
** XXX Separate tree-lib from tree-sim?

** XXX Separate seq-lib from seq-ana and seq-sim?
** TODO Also reduce complexity of tree data types
