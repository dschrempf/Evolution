* Notes
** Read from standard input
I decided to not provide an option for reading from STDIN, since this is a
corner case and additionally because behavior might be undefined when more than
one input file is given. When does one file end and the next one begin?

* Easy
** TODO Check common design
For example, NO full stop after /Description/ in module header.

* Medium
** TODO Improve output of (mixture, gamma) model

** TODO Enable description in FASTA files sequence headers

* Hard
** TODO Remove mandatory statement of code at command line
Detect code for each sequence (what do we do for very short sequences?), and
output it to log.

* Require further tought
** XXX Separate tree-lib from tree-sim?

** XXX Separate seq-lib from seq-ana and seq-sim?
