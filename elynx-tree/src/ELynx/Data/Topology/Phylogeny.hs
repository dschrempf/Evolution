--
-- A topology, as it is used in phylogenetics is a 'Topology' with unique leaf
-- labels, and the order of the topologies in the sub-forest is considered to be
-- meaningless.
--
-- Internally, however, the underlying 'Topology' data structure stores the
-- sub-forest as a (non-empty) list, which has a specific order. Hence, we have
-- to do some tricks when comparing topologies, and topology comparison is slow.
--
-- Also, the uniqueness of the leaves is not ensured by the data type, but has
-- to be checked at runtime. Functions relying on the tree to have unique leaves
-- do perform this check, and return 'Left' with an error message, if the tree
-- has duplicate leaves.
--
-- Note: Topologies are rooted.
--
-- Note: Topologies encoded in Newick format correspond to rooted topologies. By
-- convention only, a topology parsed from Newick format is usually thought to
-- be unrooted, when the root node is multifurcating and has three children.
-- This convention is not enforced here. Newick topologies are just parsed as
-- they are, and a rooted topology is returned.
--
-- The bifurcating root of a topology can be changed with 'roots', or 'rootAt'.
--
-- Topologies with multifurcating root nodes can be properly rooted using
-- 'outgroup'.
