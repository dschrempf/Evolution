EvoMod suite version 0.3. Developed by Dominik Schrempf. Compiled on May 13,

Usage: tree-sim [-t|--nTrees INT] [-n|--nLeaves INT] [-H|--height DOUBLE]
                [-l|--lambda DOUBLE] [-m|--mu DOUBLE] [-r|--rho DOUBLE]
                [-u|--sub-sample] [-s|--summary-statistics]
                [-v|--verbosity VALUE] [-o|--output-file-basename NAME]
                [-S|--seed [INT]]
  Simulate reconstructed trees using the point process. See Gernhard, T. (2008).
  The conditioned reconstructed process. Journal of Theoretical Biology, 253(4),
  769â€“778. http://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtbi.2008.04.005 The goal of the EvoMod
  suite is reproducible research. Evolutionary sequences and phylogenetic trees
  can be read, viewed, modified and simulated without assuming anything about
  the data (e.g., the type of code), and without default values. The exact
  command with all arguments has to be stated by the user and is logged
  automatically. This leads to some work overhead in the beginning, but usually
  pays off in the end.

Available options:
  -h,--help                Show this help text
  -V,--version             Show version
  -t,--nTrees INT          Number of trees (default: 10)
  -n,--nLeaves INT         Number of leaves per tree (default: 5)
  -H,--height DOUBLE       Fix tree height (no default)
  -l,--lambda DOUBLE       Birth rate lambda (default: 1.0)
  -m,--mu DOUBLE           Death rate mu (default: 0.9)
  -r,--rho DOUBLE          Sampling probability rho (default: 1.0)
  -u,--sub-sample          Perform sub-sampling; see below.
  -s,--summary-statistics  Only output number of children for each branch
  -v,--verbosity VALUE     Be verbose; one of: Quiet Info Debug (default: Info)
  -o,--output-file-basename NAME
                           Specify base name of output file
  -S,--seed [INT]          Seed for random number generator; list of 32 bit
                           integers with up to 256 elements (default: random)

Height of Trees: if no tree height is given, the heights will be randomly drawn from the expected distribution given the number of leaves, the birth and the death rate.
Summary statistics only: only print (NumberOfExtantChildren BranchLength) pairs for each branch of each tree. The trees are separated by a newline character.
Sub-sampling: simulate one big tree with n'=round(n/rho), n'>=n, leaves, and randomly sample sub-trees with n leaves. Hence, with rho=1.0, the same tree is reported over and over again.
